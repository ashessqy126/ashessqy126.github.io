I received the B.S. degree in Information Security from University of Electronic and Science Techology of China (UESTC) and received the M.S. degree in Computer Science and Techology from [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/). Later in 2021, I also worked as a research assistant in George Mason University ([GMU](https://www.gmu.edu/)), under supervision of Prof. [Kun Sun](https://csis.gmu.edu/ksun/). Now, I am a third-year Ph.D. student at Insitute of Information Engineering ([IIE](https://www.iie.ac.cn/)), Chinese Academy of Sciences. 


<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically. -->


My current research interests include **Software Security**, **Web3 Security**, and **Intrusion Detection System**. I welcome colloration and would love to discuss any related academic topics. Feel free to reach out to me via [email](mailto:songqiyang@iie.ac.cn)! Iâ€™m eager to communicate with researchers from all over the world.
